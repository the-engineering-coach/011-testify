# Go Testify: Supercharging TDD with an Assert & Mock Toolkit

This repository contains all the code for The Engineering Coach YouTube video, "Go Testify: Supercharging TDD with an Assert & Mock Toolkit."

In this video, we use Testify, a popular and powerful toolkit, to extend Golang's core testing functionality. This project serves as a practical demonstration of how to use Testify's assertion and mocking features to write more expressive and readable tests within a TDD workflow.

## What You'll Learn

  - How to set up and use the Testify toolkit in a Golang project.
  - Writing more expressive assertions with Testify.
  - Using Testify's mocking capabilities.
  - The benefits of using a toolkit to improve your test code.

## Watch the Video Tutorial

This video is an excellent resource for anyone looking to make their Golang tests faster and more reliable.
